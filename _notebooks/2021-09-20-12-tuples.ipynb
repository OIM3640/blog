    "   1. You might want to write a function that takes a word and computes a list of all the words that can be formed by removing one letter. These are the “children” of the word.\r\n",
    "   2. Recursively, a word is reducible if any of its children are reducible. As a base case, you can consider the empty string reducible.\r\n",
    "   3. The wordlist I provided, words.txt, doesn’t contain single letter words. So you might want to add “I”, “a”, and the empty string.\r\n",
    "   4. To improve the performance of your program, you might want to memoize the words that are known to be reducible."
