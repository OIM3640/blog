    "Most of the programs we have seen so far are transient in the sense that they run for a short time and produce some output, but when they end, their data disappears. If you run the program again, it starts with a clean slate.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Other programs are **persistent**: they run for a long time (or all the time); they keep at least some of their data in permanent storage (a hard drive, for example); and if they shut down and restart, they pick up where they left off.\r\n",
    "\r\n",

    "One of the simplest ways for programs to maintain their data is by reading and writing text files. We have already seen programs that read text files; in this chapter we will see programs that write them.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "An alternative is to store the state of the program in a **database**. In this chapter I will present a simple database and a module, <code>pickle</code>, that makes it easy to store program data. "
